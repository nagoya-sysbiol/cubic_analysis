# Topological data analysis (TDA) and non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) model for vascular structural analysis using high-resolution CUBIC 3D image data

---

This pipeline is a workflow for analyzing high-resolution CUBIC 3D image data and involves: (1) extraction of signals from CUBIC 3D image data, (2) generation of 3D geometic features from the signals, and (3) evaluation and visualization of the structual differences of vasculatures between samples.

With this pipeline you can

- Extract the signals from CUBIC 3d image data 
- Perform persistent homology to generate the persistent diagrams from the signals
- Fit non-homogeneous Poission process (NHPP) model to extract the topological features from the signals
- Evaluate and visualize the structural differences of vasculatures between samples using sliced Wasserstein kernel and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS)
