# Topological data analysis (TDA) and non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) model for vascular structural analysis using high-resolution CUBIC 3D image data

---

This pipeline is a workflow for analyzing high-resolution CUBIC 3D image data and involves: (1) extraction of signals from CUBIC 3D image data, (2) generation of 3D geometic features from the signals, and (3) evaluation of the structual differences of vasculatures between samples.

With this pipeline you can

- Extract 
- Perform RNA velocity and single-nuclei RNA-seq analsis
- Quantify data from numerous technologies such as 10x, inDrops, and Dropseq.
- Customize workflows for new technologies and protocols.
- Process feature barcoding data such as CITE-seq, REAP-seq, MULTI-seq, Clicktags, and Perturb-seq.
- Obtain QC reports from single-cell RNA-seq data
